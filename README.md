# TakeMe

TakeMe is a no-compromises lightweight player riding mod runs server-side.

## Why Another Player Riding Mod?

Takeme does **not** move the riding position for player vehicles. For the following reasons:

1. Aesthetic and physical looking.
2. Less ceilling hight requirement when indoors.
3. Align to vanilla.

Takeme is quite technically vanilla and it achives its main function by:

1. Use force riding.
2. Redirect `isSaveable()` in `addPassenger()` to a custom method which returns `isPlayer()` if not saveable.
3. Send `EntityPassengersSetS2CPacket` to the vehicle player when mounting or dismounting.

## Usage

Its functions can only be triggered with both hands empty by default.

### Mount Player

1. You are not sneaking.

### Carry Player

### Dismount Passenger Player

1. You are sneaking.
2. You have one or more passengers.

1. You are sneaking.

}
```

## FAQ

### I can't click on any player except the one on my head

Use client-side mods (eg. [Shoulder Surfing Reloaded](https://modrinth.com/mod/shoulder-surfing-reloaded)) to workaround this.
